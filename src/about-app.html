<div class="about-info">
	<p>Ahoy, stranger! I'm Jamie, a web developer based out of Mission, Canada. I love hacking on JavaScript web apps - particularly media-based apps - and I've always had a deep interest in 3D computer graphics (the <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_rendering_engine" target="_blank">tech behind the original Doom</a> is <em>fascinating</em>, seriously).</p>

	<p>I fell in love with programming when I was 13. Most of what I've learned has been self-taught, but I've also been to school and earned my Bachelor of Computer Information Systems to balance out my more practical skillset. I've built out 2D games, 3D rendering engines, and desktop apps, but more recently I've begun to focus on web development, working on projects like photo sharing platforms and online learning portals.</p>
	<p>My dream is to create my own product-based online business one day. Until then, however, I'd love to <span class="app-link" data-app="contact">help you with yours</span>!</p>
	<p>If you have any work you'd like to discuss, or you're just looking to grab a coffee and chitchat, please don't hesitate to <span class="app-link" data-app="contact">get in touch</span>!</p>
