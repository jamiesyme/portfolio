		<p>Hi, I'm Jamie. I'm a software developer that enjoys exploring ideas through code.</p>
		<p>When I started coding, I wanted to create games. Shortly after I started, however, I noticed that my projects naturally began to drift away from games: I was creating game engines, and then rendering engines, and then I was researching scripting language design, and then... Well, I realize now that I never really wanted to create games, but rather, I wanted to create. I wanted to take ideas and turn them into reality. So that's what I'm trying to do now (mostly through web development).</p>
		<p>Right now, I'm attending the University of the Fraser Valley, and I'll be graduating in December 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems. Until then, my plan is to continue exploring ideas in my own <a href="#" class="app-projects-link">projects</a>, and to gain as much work experience as possible. To see my progress, check out my <a href="/f/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>
		<p>I'm currently taking freelance work, so if you have a project that needs building, feel free to <a href="#" class="app-contact-link">contact me here</a>.</p>
